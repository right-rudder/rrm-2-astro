    "When Tim Jedrek, Founder and CEO of Right Rudder Marketing, met Luke and Georgette Poulos, founders of Sun City Aviation Academy, at FSANA two years ago, it marked the beginning of a transformative partnership. Sun City Aviation Academy was looking to update their website and get more leads coming into their school to increase their revenue. They had a WordPress website already built out, social media profiles, and a GMB listing, but they weren't seeing much progress in their online rankings.",

## Why M2A's Zero to Airlines Program Dominates

### Transparent All-In Pricing vs. Hourly Nickel-and-Diming

**Competitors' Hidden Costs:**

- Hourly aircraft rental: $150–250/hr
- Hourly instructor fees: $60–85/hr
- Checkride fees: $800–1,200 each (×7 = $5,600–8,400)
- Ground school: $3,000–8,000 per rating
- Housing: $1,000–2,000/month (×12–18 months = $12,000–36,000)
- Materials, headsets, iPad apps: $2,000–5,000
- Medical exams, written tests, misc fees: $2,000+

**Competitor Total (Hidden):** $110,000–$150,000+ (and climbing with overages)

**M2A Total:** **$89,500 all-in.** Period. No surprises.

### Single-Location Seamless Training vs. Fragmented Schools

- **M2A:** **Everything at Wayne Executive Jetport (KGWW)**—training, housing, checkrides, instructor employment, airline prep under one roof.

### Dual DPE Access & Guaranteed Checkride Scheduling

- **Competitors:** Single DPE dependency; 4–8 week checkride delays; weather/examiner cancellations push timelines months out.
- **M2A:** **Two Designated Pilot Examiners on staff.** **12-year track record of zero examiner-related cancellations.** Checkrides scheduled within days, not months.

### Performance-Based Airline Placement vs. Predatory Fees

- **Competitors:** Charge $3,000–$10,000 "cadet program fees" or take commissions from your first-year airline salary.
- **M2A:** **Zero placement fees.** Meet performance criteria (safety, professionalism, pass rates) and we provide **direct introductions to regional and major airline hiring partners**—no middlemen.

### Veteran Airline Captain Mentorship vs. 300-Hour Time-Builders

- **Competitors:** Learn from instructors with 250–500 hours, no airline experience, no professional mentorship.
- **M2A:** Train under **retired and active airline captains** with 10,000+ hours, decades of line experience, and proven teaching records. **"Gray beard" peer-checking ensures quality** beyond checkride minimums.

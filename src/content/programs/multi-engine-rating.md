## Your Multi-Engine Rating—Transparent, Professional, All-In

Get your multi-engine rating at **M2A Aviation Academy** with complete transparency and zero surprises. Unlike competitors who charge hourly overages, fragment training across locations, or book you out for months, we provide **all-inclusive training in one place with immediate availability**.

### What's Included—No Hidden Costs

Your **$8,500 all-in price** covers:

- **10 hours flight time** in our Piper Seminole (PA-34-220T)
- **8 hours ground instruction** with veteran airline captains
- **On-site housing** (private or shared room options)
- **Checkride with dual DPE access** (12-year zero-cancellation track record)
- **All training materials and equipment** (headset, iPad apps, charts)
- **Meals during training week**
- **Airport transportation**

No hourly add-ons. No "deposit required, then we'll see." No nickel-and-diming. **One price, full training, checkride ready.**

## Why M2A Beats the Competition

### Immediate Scheduling vs. Months-Long Waitlists

- **Competitors:** Booked out into January; $1,000 non-refundable deposits; uncertain availability.
- **M2A:** Call today, start within 7–14 days. Professional operations manager responds within 24 hours.

### Single-Location Training vs. Fragmented Instruction

- **Competitors:** Ground school at one location, sim at another, flights at a third airport. Some list multi-engine training but **have no multi-engine aircraft**.
- **M2A:** All training at Wayne Executive Jetport (KGWW)—ground, flight, checkride, housing under one roof.

### Transparent Pricing vs. Hourly Overages

- **Competitors:** "$450/hr aircraft + $62/hr instructor + sim fees"—final cost unknown until you finish (and often exceed $10,000+).
- **M2A:** **$8,500 all-in.** You know exactly what you'll pay before you start.

### Dual DPEs & Zero Cancellations vs. Uncertain Checkride Dates

- **Competitors:** Single DPE availability; weather cancellations push checkrides weeks out.
- **M2A:** **Two Designated Pilot Examiners on staff.** 12-year track record of **zero checkride cancellations** due to examiner unavailability.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I complete the rating in 5 days?**  
**A:** Yes—most students finish in 5–7 days with focused, full-time training. We recommend arriving on Sunday evening, starting Monday morning, and taking your checkride Friday or Saturday.

**Q: What if weather delays my training?**  
**A:** We build in weather contingency days. If delays occur, housing and instruction are adjusted at no additional cost. Our dual DPE access ensures checkride flexibility.

**Q: Do I need an instrument rating first?**  
**A:** Not required, but **strongly recommended**. Multi-engine training emphasizes IFR procedures; instrument-rated pilots progress faster and perform better on checkrides.

**Q: Can I use my own headset/iPad?**  
**A:** Absolutely. We provide equipment if needed, but you're welcome to use your own gear.

**Q: What if I need more than 10 hours of flight time?**  
**A:** Additional flight hours are available at $350/hr (aircraft + instructor). Most students complete within the 10-hour block; our instructors are efficient and focused.

**Q: Is housing shared or private?**

---

## Why M2A's Private Pilot Program Stands Out

### Experienced CFI Instructors (Not Just Time-Builders)

- **Competitors:** Assign students to 250-hour instructors building time toward airlines—high turnover, inconsistent teaching, limited real-world experience.
- **M2A:** Instructors with **1,500+ hours and airline/professional backgrounds**. Many are career educators or retired airline pilots who **genuinely love teaching**, not just logging hours.

### Realistic Flight Hour Expectations

- **Competitors:** Advertise "Private Pilot in 40 Hours!" knowing 95% of students need 60-70 hours—creating bill shock and frustration.
- **M2A:** **Transparent 60+ hour pricing upfront**. Most students finish within included hours; if you need 65-70 hours, minimal additional cost ($150/hr).

### Quality Over Speed

Unlike "pilot factories" rushing students through checkrides, M2A emphasizes **foundational skills, decision-making, and safety culture**. You'll finish as a **confident, competent pilot**—not just someone who barely passed a checkride.

### Modern Aircraft & Glass Cockpit Training

Train in **Garmin G1000-equipped aircraft** (industry-standard glass cockpit). Learn modern avionics from day one—critical for career advancement and real-world flying.

### Flexible Scheduling (Full-Time or Part-Time)

- **Full-time students:** Train 5-6 days/week; finish in 3-4 months
- **Part-time students:** Train 2-3 days/week; finish in 4-6 months
- **Accelerated intensive:** Relocate for 6-8 weeks; train daily with housing included

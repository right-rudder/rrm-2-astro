## Why M2A's MEI Program Is Different

### Performance-Based Airline Placement (Not Predatory Commissions)

- **Competitors:** Require instructors to pay $3,000–$5,000 in "placement fees" or take commissions from your salary.
- **M2A:** **Zero placement fees.** Meet our performance criteria (safety, professionalism, student pass rates) and we connect you directly with airline hiring partners—no middleman commissions.

### Build Twin Time, Earn Income, Fast-Track Your Career

Most MEI graduates stay on at M2A to instruct in multi-engine aircraft—**building valuable twin time** while earning competitive instructor pay. Within 6–12 months, you'll have the multi-engine hours airlines want, plus proven instructional experience.

### Veteran Airline Captain Mentorship

You'll train under **retired and active airline captains** with 10,000+ hours and decades of multi-engine experience. Our "gray beard" mentors provide **continuation training and peer-checking**—quality assurance no competitor offers.

### Dual DPE Access & Zero Cancellations

Unlike competitors dependent on single examiners, M2A has **two Designated Pilot Examiners on staff**. Our **12-year track record of zero checkride cancellations** means you finish on schedule.

## Who This Program Is For

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I don't use all my block hours within 6 months?**

**A:** Block hours are valid for **6 months by default**; extensions available for $100 (adds 3 months). We're flexible—life happens, and we want you to maximize your investment.

**Q: Can I split block hours between solo and dual instruction?**

**A:** Absolutely. Use block hours however you need—solo PIC time-building, dual instruction, safety pilot arrangements, or a mix. Flexibility is the point.

**Q: What if I cancel or reschedule a flight?**

**A:** Cancellations with **48-hour notice** are free—no penalty. Less than 48 hours: $50 rescheduling fee. No-shows: one block hour forfeited. Weather cancellations: zero penalty.

**Q: Can I bring my own safety pilot?**

**A:** Yes—if your safety pilot holds a multi-engine rating and current medical. M2A coordinates scheduling and ensures insurance compliance. If you don't have a safety pilot, we'll match you with one.

**Q: Do block hours count toward insurance minimums for solo flying?**

**A:** M2A's insurance allows solo multi-engine flying for rated pilots with **minimum 10 hours multi-engine PIC** and current BFR. If you're below minimums, initial hours must be dual until insurance requirements are met.

**Q: Can I use block hours for checkride prep?**

**A:** Yes—block hours are perfect for **checkride refreshers, flight reviews (BFR), or IPC (Instrument Proficiency Check)** in multi-engine aircraft.

**Q: What if I want to buy more hours mid-block?**

**A:** Easy—purchase additional blocks anytime. Upgraded rates apply to new purchases (e.g., if you started with 10-hour block and buy 50-hour block later, new block is at 50-hour rate).
